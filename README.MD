## Lore

Welcome to FEUPHell!

You play as a blue cube engineer that was brought from another dimension to FEUP. At night, all the cubes in the world, yourself included, animate. However, during one of these nights, red cubes started coming after you and they would not stop!

You will battle yourself out of FEUP, fighting endless waves of enemies with the help of a wide variety of weapons and perks!

Feel free to explore the outdoors area, as well as replicas of some of your favourite rooms of the faculty.
